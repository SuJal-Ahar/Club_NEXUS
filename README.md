# üåê Club Nexus: Campus Event and Club Management

## üåü Project Overview

**Club Nexus** is a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) built to streamline the management of student clubs and campus events. The goal is to provide a central, easy-to-use platform for students to discover activities and for club organizers to manage their memberships and event listings.

### Features

  * **Intuitive UI:** Built with **React** and styled for a sleek, modern aesthetic (including a **Neon Glow** heading and interactive buttons).
  * **Event Discovery:** A central place for viewing all active campus events.
  * **Club Management:** Functionality for club leaders to manage their club details and members (future feature).
  * **Dynamic UX:** Includes background sound on page load (with a **Mute Toggle**) for an enhanced, immersive user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with **Vite** and uses **React** and **JavaScript/JSX**.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown in your terminal) to view it in the browser. The page will auto-reload as you make edits.

## ü§ù Next Steps & Contributions

Future development plans include:

1.  **Routing:** Implement client-side routing (e.g., using React Router) to navigate from the home page to `/events` and `/clubs`.
2.  **Data Models:** Integrate a database/backend to handle CRUD operations for Events and Clubs.
3.  **Authentication:** Implement user login/registration (students and organizers).
